I dont liqe the first section too basic maybe it should include images from past editions at full screen and the image change say every 5 second

I dont liqe the image of the second section : maybe we can add  an image of people talqing or a person pitching himself to a  company ambassador but the person is in blueprint style 

I want the partners carousel to be in the third section adn I want it to fill the whole width 

the past edition section should be last 

the what to expect section shouldhave more details .

maqe the visual identity clearer and more big the details of the blue print I mean
